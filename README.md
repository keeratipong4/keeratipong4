# Hi, I'm Keeratipong 👋 😄 

You can also call me **Qi**.

I'm a **Web Developer** based in Bangkok, Thailand. After dedicating over 12 years to running my own business, I've transitioned into a career as a **Front-End Developer**. Over the past year, I've focused on mastering modern web development technologies through hands-on projects.

If I had known how steep the learning curve would be, I might have considered giving up at the very start of my journey. The more coding skill I acquire, the more i realize how much there is still to learn. The deeper i dive into coding, the more I understand how little I truly know. This has led me to pursue a career in coding.

## 👤 Personality
Besides practicing coding skills, I commit myself to practice weight training 5 days a week over the last 11 years. Sometimes I enjoy making videos and share my story on social media, and I used to gain huge audiences on Youtube. 😄🎉
